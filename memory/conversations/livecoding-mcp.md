# Session Summary: Livecoding MCP Tools in Smalltalk

## Overview
This session focused on learning to create and modify MCP tools by
livecoding in a remote Smalltalk. We successfully created a new MCP
tool (`song_properties_get_tempo`) for the Ableton Live MCP server.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Exploring Smalltalk Classes

Review the input schema of the Smalltalk MCP server's "send" tool, for
sending messages, and its "peer" tool, for getting a reference to a
utility Smalltalk object, to which you can send messages. An object
reference, from your point of view, is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

**Essential Messages:**
- `classNamed:` - get a class by name (send to peer)
- `class` - get the metaclass of a class
- `superclass` - get the superclass of a class
- `selectors` - get methods defined by a class
- `sourceCodeAt:` - get source code for a method (takes a Symbol)
- `allInstVarNames` - get instance variable names of a class
- `browse` - open a browser (for human use, not agent)

**Class vs Metaclass:**
- Classes define instance methods
- Metaclasses define class methods
- Send `class` to a class to get its metaclass
- Class-side methods are defined by the metaclass

### 2. Compiling Smalltalk Methods

**Method: `peer compile:classified:in:`**

Parameters:
1. `source` (String) - method source code
2. `methodCategory` (String) - category name (e.g., "accessing", "initialization")
3. `class` (object reference) - the class object to compile into

**Process:**
1. Compose method source with proper Smalltalk syntax
2. Send `compile:classified:in:` to peer
3. Method halts for human review
4. Human proceeds from debugger if approved, or terminates if rejected
   (and the MCP tool call times out)

**Smalltalk Syntax Notes:**
- String literals use single quotes: `'text'`
- Comments use double quotes: `"comment"`
- Symbols start with `#`: `#selector`
- Closures use square brackets: `[expression]`
- Assignment: `:=`
- Return: `^`

### 3. MCP Tool Framework Architecture

**Tool Registration Pattern:**
```smalltalk
[ReceiverExpression]
    aiToolNamed: #tool_name
    withDescription: 'Tool description.'
    forSelector: #methodSelector:
```

**Components:**
1. **Receiver** - Either a class or a closure that evaluates to an instance
2. **Tool name** - Symbol following naming convention (class_type_name)
3. **Description** - String describing what the tool does
4. **Selector** - Symbol of the method to invoke. That method should
   be defined before this registration. For each of its arguments, and
   its result (if any), that method has a pragma detailing the name,
   type, and description.

**Method Pragmas for MCP:**
```smalltalk
<param: #paramName type: #string description: 'param description'>
<result: #resultKey type: #number description: 'result description'>
```

These pragmas are used by the MCP framework to automatically generate
JSON schemas.

**Return Format:**
Methods should return dictionaries: `{#key -> value}`

### 4. Complete Workflow for Adding an MCP Tool

For an MCPServer subclass named "ServerClass"...

1. **Define/modify the implementation method** with MCP pragmas:
   ```smalltalk
   methodName: param1
       <param: #param1 type: #string description: 'description'>
       <result: #resultKey type: #type description: 'description'>
       ^{#resultKey -> computation}
   ```

2. **Compile the method** using `peer compile:classified:in:`

3. **Update initializeTools** on the MCP server class to register the tool

4. **Evaluate `ServerClass initialize`** to reinitialize with new tools

5. **Refresh agent's MCP client** tools list (currently, the user must
   do this manually in Kiro)

### 5. Project Structure

**Key Classes:**
- `Tether` - manages MCP connection, provides utility methods
- `MCPServer` - base class for MCP servers
- `LiveMCPServer` - Ableton Live MCP server
- `SmalltalkMCPServer` - Smalltalk MCP server
- `Live*` classes - Ableton Live object model

**Local Agent Context Memory File Organization:**
- `memory/` - context files, logs, summaries
- `memory/code/` - any utility scripts you need to write (in
  JavaScript, for execution by NodeJS)
- `memory/objects.json` - tracked object exposure hashes (rotate at 10KB)
- `memory/smalltalk-calls.log` - logging before and after all MCP send
  calls (rotate at 10KB)

### 7. Practical Tips

**Logging Strategy:**
- Log before AND after every tool call
- Include encoded arguments and decoded results
- Self-contained logs (don't reference other files)
- Rotate logs at 10KB

**Working with the Peer:**
- Peer object is a Tether instance
- Provides utility methods: `classNamed:`, `allClassCategories`, etc.
- Use it as the entry point for exploring the system

## Example: The song_properties_get_tempo Tool

**Implementation Method (LiveSong>>tempo):**
```smalltalk
tempo
    "Current tempo of the Live Set in BPM, 20.0 ... 999.0..."
    <access: #(get set observe)>
    <result: #tempo type: #number description: 'current tempo in BPM'>
    ^{#tempo -> super tempo}
```

**Registration (in LiveMCPServer class>>initializeTools):**
```smalltalk
[LiveSong activeInstance]
    aiToolNamed: #song_properties_get_tempo
    withDescription: 'Get the current tempo of the Live set.'
    forSelector: #tempo
```

**Result:**
```json
{"tempo": 217.976318359375}
```

## Next Steps

Future work could include:
- Creating more Ableton Live MCP tools as needed
- Exploring the Smalltalk MCP server capabilities
- Understanding how `aiToolNamed:withDescription:forSelector:` works internally
- Learning about the `withTag:` method for resolving object paths
- Investigating how the MCP framework generates JSON schemas from pragmas
- Ultimately, user wants to develop this project context into a
  generally useful Smalltalk livecoding assistant.
